    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to have
    several windows side-by-side.  The default wrapping on such devices looks
    ugly.  Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
    For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments), limiting the

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.

    one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

    comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.
    They should start with a # and a single space.

    Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space
    (unless it is indented text inside the comment).

    Continuation lines indentation.

    Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
    using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets
    and braces, or using a hanging indent.

    When using a hanging indent these considerations should be applied:
    - there should be no arguments on the first line, and
    - further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a
      continuation line.

sflegacy.py:49:1: E303 too many blank lines (3)
    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related
    functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related
    one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\ndef b():\n    pass
    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n# Foo\n# Bar\n\ndef b():\n    pass
