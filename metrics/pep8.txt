    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to have

    Continuation lines indentation.

    Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
    using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets
    and braces, or using a hanging indent.

    When using a hanging indent these considerations should be applied:
    - there should be no arguments on the first line, and
    - further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a
      continuation line.
