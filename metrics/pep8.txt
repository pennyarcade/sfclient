sfclient.py:4007:1: E265 block comment should start with '# '
    Separate inline comments by at least two spaces.

    An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.  Inline
    comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.
    They should start with a # and a single space.

    Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space
    (unless it is indented text inside the comment).

sfclient.py:4207:17: E124 closing bracket does not match visual indentation
    Continuation lines indentation.

    Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
    using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets
    and braces, or using a hanging indent.

    When using a hanging indent these considerations should be applied:
    - there should be no arguments on the first line, and
    - further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a
      continuation line.

    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
