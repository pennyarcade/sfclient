sfclient.py:2724:16: E211 whitespace before '('
    Avoid extraneous whitespace.

    Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
    - before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a
      function call.
    - before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing.

    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related
    functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related
    one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\ndef b():\n    pass
    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n# Foo\n# Bar\n\ndef b():\n    pass
