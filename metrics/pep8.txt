sfsavegame.py:39:23: E222 multiple spaces after operator
    Avoid extraneous whitespace around an operator.

    Okay: a = 12 + 3
    E221: a = 4  + 5
    E222: a = 4 +  5
    E223: a = 4\t+ 5
    E224: a = 4 +\t5
sfsavegame.py:46:13: E113 unexpected indentation
    Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

    For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can continue to
    use 8-space tabs.

    Okay: a = 1
    Okay: if a == 0:\n    a = 1
    E111:   a = 1

    Okay: for item in items:\n    pass
    E112: for item in items:\npass

    Okay: a = 1\nb = 2
    E113: a = 1\n    b = 2
sfsavegame.py:69:5: E303 too many blank lines (2)
    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related
    functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related
    one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\ndef b():\n    pass
    Okay: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n# Foo\n# Bar\n\ndef b():\n    pass

    E301: class Foo:\n    b = 0\n    def bar():\n        pass
    E302: def a():\n    pass\n\ndef b(n):\n    pass
    E303: def a():\n    pass\n\n\n\ndef b(n):\n    pass
    E303: def a():\n\n\n\n    pass
    E304: @decorator\n\ndef a():\n    pass
