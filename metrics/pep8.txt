sfclient.py:25472:1: W293 blank line contains whitespace
    Trailing whitespace is superfluous.

    The warning returned varies on whether the line itself is blank, for easier
    filtering for those who want to indent their blank lines.

sfclient.py:29737:24: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
    Continuation lines indentation.

    Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically
    using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets
    and braces, or using a hanging indent.

    When using a hanging indent these considerations should be applied:
    - there should be no arguments on the first line, and
    - further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a
      continuation line.
